# What is Transifex Native?

A new way to localise software within the code - no files no deployments. A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzEOCKNjRZU) is worth a thousand words!
But if you are a words person here is the [documentation](https://docs.transifex.com/transifex-native-sdk-overview/introduction).

# Try it out yourself

  
  - [x] Step 1: Clone the repo and go to the folder of your preference. There is one for each of the following languages / frameworks: [django](https://github.com/transifex/transifex-native-sandbox/tree/master/django) and [ReactJS](https://github.com/transifex/transifex-native-sandbox/tree/master/reactjs) (Python, JS, and React Native folders to be added soon).


  - [x] Step 2: Set things up using the guide included in each folder mentioned in the previous step. it's literally 3 commands. 
        If you are not up to it we've built a script to do it for you. Just do ```sh run.sh```
  

  - [x] Step 3: :ok_hand: Play around. Push your strings to Transifex, translate, make edits and see your changes being applied on the fly. The repo is linked to a public Transifex project - which you can join automatically. We've also enable Machine Translation for the purposes of the test so that you don't have to do the translations yourself.

  :metal: The i18n syntax is the same across programming languages so you can share strings and translations across programming languages
 
 
  :metal:	Transifex Native is open source and can be easily ported to other languages. Check the resources section below.
