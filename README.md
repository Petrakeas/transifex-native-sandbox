# What is Transifex Native?

A new way to localise software - no files no deployments. A [video](though) is worth a thousand words!
But if you are a words person here is the [documentation](https://docs.transifex.com/transifex-native-sdk-overview/introduction).

# Want to try it out yourself?
  
  Step 1: Clone the repo of your preference (Python, django, JS, React or React Native)

  Step 2: Set things up using this guide: it's literally 3 commands. 
  <ADD GUIDE here>

  If you are not up to it we've built a script to do it for you. Just do <command>

  Step 3: Push your strings to Transifex with this <command>

  Note :We've enable MT so that you don't have to do the translations yourself.
  
  Step 4: Pull your translations.
 
  You are all set. Your page is live and translated.
  
 Note: The i18n syntax is the same across programming languages so you can share strings across apps and programming languages
 
 Note: Transifex Native is open source and can be easily ported to other languages.
 
 Note: You can share the experience with your localisation team: Translate in transifex, refresh the github webpage and see your translation live on the fly.
