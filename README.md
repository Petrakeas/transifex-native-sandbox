# What is Transifex Native?

A new way to localise software within the code - no files no deployments. A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzEOCKNjRZU) is worth a thousand words!
But if you are a words person here is the [documentation](https://docs.transifex.com/transifex-native-sdk-overview/introduction).

# Try it out yourself
  
  Step 1: Clone the repo of your preference (Python, django, JS, React or React Native)

  Step 2: Set things up using this guide: it's literally 3 commands. 
  <ADD GUIDE here>

  If you are not up to it we've built a script to do it for you. Just do <command>

  Step 3: Push your strings to Transifex with this <command>

  Note :We've enable MT so that you don't have to do the translations yourself.
  
  Step 4: Pull your translations.
 
  :ok_hand: You are all set. Your page is live and translated.
  
 Note: The i18n syntax is the same across programming languages so you can share strings and translations across programming languages
 
 Note: Transifex Native is open source and can be easily ported to other languages. Check the resources section below.
